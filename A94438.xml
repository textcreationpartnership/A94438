            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving in the Country receiv'd your Argument againſt a <hi>Standing Army,</hi> and your Letter to the Author of the <hi>Balancing Letter,</hi> as alſo that, all in Print, I had the Curioſity of deſiring to diſcourſe with you, if poſſible, or at leaſt to be Inform'd who the Author is; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred on my Journey to <hi>London,</hi> I take this way of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence; I own your ſaid Letters make me doubt your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon I thought you to be, deſerving thanks from thoſe that are againſt a <hi>Standing Army;</hi> for one would have expected at leaſt a Civil, and Gentleman-like Anſwer to One, who you ſay had level'd at you in Soft Language and Gentleman-like Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. But you therein ſhew your ſelf ſuch a Maſter of the Art of Ridiculing, that you'll deſerve the Doctors Chair.</p>
            <p>Now I deſire leave to ask you ſome plain Queſtions. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ratifications of Peace, Exchang'd between thoſe Crown'd Heads, States and Princes, that have been Engaged in the late War, The <hi>French</hi> King's Reſtoring thoſe many Towns, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Forts, and Caſtles, to thoſe from whom they had been unjuſtly taken, The Ceaſing Hoſtilities, Diſmiſſing, Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Disbanding many of the Forces, may not be ſufficient Demonſtrations of Peace, without an Article of Faith? For it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153657:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 29 -->ſeeems by your Suppoſition, <hi>Page</hi> the 4th. that you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it to be an Honourable Peace. In the next place you make a great pother, and Chuck your ſelf, as if you had gain'd the Garland of a Martial Dance, before <hi>Ammozonian</hi> Ladies! When you wrangle at the <hi>Balancers</hi> calling an Army a Land Force: Pray of what Compoſition is a Regulated Militia, without Swords and Piſtols, Pikes and Muskets, Powder and Ball, to kill Men? Theſe are you ſay, the Inſtruments and Materials of a <hi>Standing Army.</hi> And now you have three Names for one and the ſame thing; and your Regulated Militia may for ought you and I know, be as dreadful as a <hi>Standing Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Simily is pleaſant, but your Conſequence wrong; and every Law Conveyancer in <hi>England</hi> will tell you, that 'tis uſual to incert a Covenant for further Inſurance, in the ſpace of ſeven Years; and the Warranty for a Year, and a day, in <hi>Holland,</hi> is to the ſame purpoſe: And good reaſon that the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer ſhould have his Land for Ever. But you may as well ſuppoſe, that becauſe the Commons in Parliament gave Aids of Four ſhillings in the Pound from Year to Year, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People of <hi>England</hi> muſt pay Four ſhillings in the Pound for Ever.</p>
            <p>Next after your Civil way of Quibling upon Modes, and Faſhions, <hi>Page</hi> 6. and 7. you ſay, <hi>Nature hath Armed all Creatures with Weapons to oppoſe thoſe that aſſault them;</hi> And, <hi>That the ſole Debate is in whoſe Hands theſe Weapons ſhould be put;</hi> of which you have, it ſeems, diſcourſed from the 18th to the 26th <hi>Page</hi> of your Argument.</p>
            <p>Come, Sir, if inſtead of this, you had propoſed how a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Militia ſhall be maintained, and that leſs grievous to the People, then ſuch Supplies as may ſerve to maintain ſuch Troops and Companies of the Army as the King Lord and Commons ſhall agree to keep up, your Argument would have had ſome Weight: But I had almoſt ſaid you know little of the matter.</p>

Are they only Mercenary Soldiers whom you call Butchers, that profeſs to kill Men for Six pence a day? What do you call thoſe Militia Foot-men, and Horſe-men, who make their Maſters Pay Three ſhillings a Day to Carry their Arms, and Five ſhillings a day to Ride their Horſes with Arms, all boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in words to Kill Men, or Run away?</p>
            <p>Are the Mercenary Soldiers Robbers of Henrooſts, and their Officers Damme Blades, Raviſhers of Women, Debauchees, and other dreadful Names, by which you are pleaſed to call them.</p>
            <p>Then pray, What are thoſe Militia Soldiers and Officers, againſt whom (when they had been drawn out of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the Maritime Counties, upon apprehenſion of Invaſion not long ſince) there were Complaints of many Victuallers, Shopkeepers, Farmers, and other honeſt Houſekeepers, that not only their Poultry, but their Piggs, Sheep, and Goods were taken away, and Quarters left unpaid? Ay, and the good People would have made Hue and Cry after ſeveral of thoſe Officers, to have kept certain Males, and Females, begotten of their Daughters, and Servants, were it not that thereby they muſt have brought ſome Scandal to their Family: Now pray Sir tell the World wherein the Militia Soldiers appear more Vertuous (or leſs to be fear'd) then a <hi>Standing Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the Militia of <hi>England</hi> may be made more uſeful then it is, or ever was, and I heartily wiſh it may be Effected: But this will be a Work of Time, and may be a Matter of great Debate, how Money ſhall be Levied to defray the Annual Charges; for altho the Number ſhould be reduced to Sixty thouſand, as you propoſe, yet that Number will be more Chargeable then Twenty thouſand of the preſent <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what's to be done in caſe of Invaſion in the mean time? You have not given ſuch Rules, and Methods, as can be rely'd on.</p>

To be plain, there is ſome Snake in the Graſs, tho your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Topick is <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and to avoid Arbitrary Power and Slavery.
